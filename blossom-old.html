                    <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                    <p>It's my first day at Enchantix Academy! I've never met fairies other than Love Fairies like me, so this is exciting! I know this school year's gonna be great!</p>

                    <p>A girl with green hair waved at me.</p>
                    <p>"Hello. What's your name?"</p>
                    <p>"I'm Blossom!"</p>
                    <p>"Bubbles?"</p>
                    <p>"Blossom."</p>
                    <p>"Nice to meet you, Buttercup. I'm Blackthorne."</p>
                    <p>We shook hands.</p>

                    <p>I found a girl with black hair sitting by the edge of a lake. She talked to herself while she wrote in a black-and-white notebook. She might need a friend…</p>
                    <p>"Hi!" I greeted. (I think I startled her. She nearly dropped her notebook...) "I'm Blossom."</p>
                    <p>"Oh... Hi..." she greeted back.</p>
                    <p>"Are you okay?"</p>
                    <p>"I'm just surprised. No one talks to me."</p>
                    <p>"You're Seo Hyun-mi, right?"</p>
                    <p>"Mhm."</p>
                    <p>"What kind of powers do you have?" I asked.</p>

                    <p>Hyun-mi hesitated for a moment. "Are you sure you want to know? This is the part where everyone goes away."</p>
                    <p>"Why would I go away?"</p>
                    <p>"Because of, well, this..."</p>
                    <p>Hyun-mi formed a dark purple ball of shadow in her hands. I thought it was pretty, not scary!</p>
                    <p>"You're not scared?" Hyun-mi asked. "That's dark magic. I—"</p>
                    <p>"Having dark magic doesn't make you a bad person."</p>
                    <p>"I know, but people don't think that's true. Just look."</p>

                    <p>A group of three girls teased another girl with orange hair and attacked her with dark magic. The orange-haired girl sent them blasting off with an explosion of flames.</p>
                    <p>"You're not like them," I reassured her.</p>
                    <p>"Thanks... But I better get going."</p>
                    <p>Hyun-mi ran off somewhere.</p>
                    <p>"See you tomorrow!"</p>
                    <p>I might be Hyun-mi's first friend. I can't imagine the idea of someone going without friends for that long...</p>
                    <p>Well, I can think about that later! I have homework to do. See you, Diary!</p>

                    <h3>Monday, March 11</h3>
                    <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                    <p>I'm in Flora's Biology class! Not only was Flora herself teaching, but Roxy was there, too! The New Trix are still bullying Hyun-mi, though.</p>
                    <p>"Good morning, class!" Flora greeted.</p>
                    <p>"Good morning!" everyone greeted back. Well, almost everyone.</p>
                    <p>"For today's lesson—Are you okay, Hyun-mi?"</p>
                    <p>A part of Hyun-mi's face turned black.</p>
                    <label class="prev" for="checkbox-page-4">&lt;-</label>

                <div id="front-5" class="front-page">
                    <p>Black wings grew from her shoulders.</p>
                    <p>"You're becoming the monster you were meant to be," Ariadne teased.</p>
                    <p>Hyun-mi couldn't take it anymore. She gasped for air and cried until a crow her size flew around the classroom. What could I do...?</p>
                    <p>"Heath, can you please calm her down?" Flora asked.</p>
                    <p>Heath may be the strongest one in our class, but she's actually quite gentle. Heath grabbed Hyun-mi out of the air and hugged her.</p>

                    <p>Heath's left hand glowed with a green light when she stroked Hyun-mi's wings. Hyun-mi calmed down, but she still tried to bite the New Trix.</p>
                    <p>"It's not working?" Flora asked.</p>
                    <p>"Sorry, ma'am," Heath apologized. "My brother's the expert in animal magic, not me."</p>
                    <p>"I'll try," Roxy said. A blue-green light shone from her hands as she stroked Hyun-mi's wings. She made progress, but she wasn't able to turn Hyun-mi back to normal.</p>

                    <p>And she's Roxy, the <u>most powerful</u> Animal Fairy!</p>
                    <p>Hyun-mi shattered a classroom window and flew outside.</p>
                    <p>I transformed into my Charmix and flew after her in a series of sudden ascents, sharp turns, and nosedives I didn't know I could do. Out of nowhere, a beam of ice homed in on Hyun-mi. I formed a shield for her, but the ice passed through and nearly hit her. I pushed Hyun-mi out of the way and took the hit.</p>

                    <p>Moments later, I found myself in my bed, freezing cold.</p>
                    <p>"Are you okay?" A blurry black-and-white silhouette asked. Hyun-mi was back to normal!</p>
                    <p>"Are <u>you</u> okay?" I asked back. "My vision's a bit blurry, but I'm fine."</p>
                    <p>"I'm okay, too. But I can't believe you nearly DIED, but you're worrying about me. Heath, Roxy, and Helia helped a lot. Helia insisted on tending to you, but I told her thawing you out was enough."</p>

                    <p>"Anyway, class is already over—"</p>
                    <p>Someone knocked on the door. Hyun-mi answered the door to Flora and Roxy.</p>
                    <p>"Blossom's right here."</p>
                    <p>Flora and Roxy followed Hyun-mi to my bed.</p>
                    <p>"I can get up," I insisted.</p>
                    <p>My flowy dress got snagged on one of the bed posts. Wait a minute! I didn't <u>own</u> a flowy dress...</p>

                <div id="back-7" class="back-page">
                    <p>I looked in the mirror and saw that I wore a pale pink flowy dress that faded into hot pink at the end and white barefoot sandals that coiled around my calves. I had white gloves that almost reached my shoulders. I wore a gold tiara with a pink heart-shaped gem and a pink beaded necklace. Instead of the small red heart-shaped wings I normally had, I had a pair of pink butterfly wings with pink jewels hanging off it that made a heart when they were put together.</p>
                    <p>"You look amazing..." Hyun-mi marveled.</p>

                    <p>"Nope," Hyun-mi replied. "I'm from Earth. My fairy side is from Darkholm. Why do you ask?"</p>
                    <p>"We earned our Enchantix by saving people for our home world," Flora replied. Roxy pouted. "How did you earn your Enchantix, Roxy?"</p>
                    <p>"I 'earned' it by earning my Believix," Roxy said.</p>

                    <p>Mom got up and rolled her sleeves up. "Excuse me. I'll have a quick word with Principal Stern."</p>
                    <p>Mom left the room. Shortly after, I heard muffled screams outside.</p>

                    <p>"It's not your fault," I assured her.</p>
                    <p>"I didn't want you to get involved. You know everyone <u>hates</u> Dark Fairies. They only have a dorm because one of the founders was one."</p>

                    <p>"Blossom!" Hyun-mi's muffled but clearly excited voice said.</p>
                    <p>I never saw her happy or excited too often, so it immediately put a smile on my face. "What is it?"</p>
                    <p>"Principal Stern got fired! It turns out he got similar complaints from other parents, too. He's being replaced by someone named Port Bow."</p>

                    <p>Soleil breathed in through her teeth. "You see, Persephone's mom is part of the school board."</p>
                    <p>Persephone was one of the New Trix. If one of their moms was part of the school board...</p>

                    <p>Soleil ran off.</p>
                    <p>"See you tomorrow!" I waved.</p>
                    <p>"My respect for her just... skyrocketed," Hyun-mi said when Soleil wasn't in earshot. "The other class presidents at my old schools just called me a 'troublemaker' and left it at that. Same with the teachers."</p>
                    <p>"Even the principals?" I asked.</p>
                    <p>"Principal Stern wasn't anything new."</p>
                    <p>"Oh..."</p>
                    <p>"...Let's not think about that. Want to swim at the Mermaid Grotto?"</p>
                    <p>"Sure! You can go ahead."</p>

                    <p>Hyun-mi ran to her dorm and got changed. The New Trix were out shopping like they usually were, so Hyun-mi basically had the Dark Dorm to herself.</p>
