                <h3>September 3</h3>
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>It's my first day at Enchantix Academy. And I'm on my own...</p>
                <p>I went through all of the classes. No one noticed me. That's fine. I'd rather be invisible than a laughingstock.</p>
                <p>Or, at least, I thought I was invisible.</p>
                <p>"Hi!" a girl with pink curly hair greeted. I nearly dropped you, Diary, but I managed to catch you in time. "I'm Blossom."</p>
                <p>"Oh... Hi..." I greeted back, trying to process what just happened.</p>
                <p>"Are you okay?" she asked.</p>
                <p>"I'm just surprised," I replied. "No one bothers to talk to me. And when I make an effort, the person I'm trying to befriend ignores me."</p>
                <p>I immediately realized that I should <u>not</u> have said that.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>"You're Seo Hyun-mi, right?"</p>
                <p>"Mhm."</p>
                <p>"What kind of powers do you have?" she asked.</p>
                <p>Shoot. Should I just lie? No. It'll be even worse when she finds out I lied. I guess I'll tell the truth, then.</p>
                <p>"Are you sure you want to know? This is the part where everyone goes away."</p>
                <p>"Why would I go away?"</p>
                <p>"Because of, well, this..."</p>
                <p>I formed a ball of shadow in my hands. Instead of running away, she seemed to be fascinated by it.</p>
                <p>"You're not scared?" I asked. "That's dark magic. I—"</p>
                <p>"Having dark magic doesn't make you a bad person."</p>
                <p>"I know, but people don't think that's true. Just look."</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>A group of three older girls, one with silver-blue hair tied in a high ponytail, another with long brown hair with two lighter brown streaks tied into braids, and yet another with a high dark purple hairstyle with light purple steaks on the sides, teased another girl with short fiery orange hair. The victim drove them away with an explosion of multicolored flames.</p>
                <p>"You're not like them," she reassured me.</p>
                <p>"Thanks... But I better get going."</p>
                <p>I picked my pen up and went back to the dorms.</p>
                <p>"Good luck!"</p>
                <p>Why is Blossom being so nice to me? What could she possibly want with powers like mine?</p>
                <p>Never mind. It doesn't matter now. Time to do my homework, I guess.</p>
                <p class="signature">Love, Hyun-mi</p>

                <h3>Monday, October 28</h3>
                <p>Dear Diary,</p>
                <p>I woke up in the dungeon of the Dark Fairy dorms.</p>
                <p>"Looks like all of the Light Fairies are locked up," I heard Khione say.</p>
                <p>"I'm a Dark Fairy. Why are you locking me up?" I demanded.</p>
                <p>"You're so soft, you might as well be a Light Fairy."</p>
                <p>"Blossom!" I called when I saw her walk in.</p>
                <p>Blossom gave me a glare with glowing purple eyes. No. They couldn't have done this. They couldn't have.</p>
                <p>"I hope you rot in this cell."</p>
                <p>She wouldn't say that. She would <u>never</u> say that.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>"Dragon Essence."</p>
                <p>Helia trapped Soleil in a tornado of fire.</p>
                <p>When the tornado died down, Ariadne said, "Cursed Lightning!"</p>
                <p>I saw Soleil's eyes turn red for a second.</p>
                <p>"Succumb, Soleil," Ariadne taunted.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>"I—No, it's too crazy. I don't know where to go from here..."</p>
                <p>"What's your idea?"</p>
                <p>I whispered, "I thought maybe I could disguise you a Dark Fairy. Maybe they'd let you out and... I don't know. It's probably not the best idea."</p>
                <p>"It's <u>an</u> idea. It's worth a shot!"</p>
                <p>She had a point. "Okay. Hold on."</p>
                <p>What would a Light Fairy look like as a Dark Fairy? She has her Enchantix... Maybe a darker version of her dress? Red eyes, maybe? Jagged wings? Then again, if I haven't seen her transform into a Dark Fairy, no one else has.</p>
                <p>"Ready?" I asked.</p>
                <p>"Wait, what if they try to read my mind?"</p>
                <p>"Then I'll use a mind-reading spell of my own. None of us are skilled enough to read someone's mind when it's already being read."</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>"Huh."</p>
                <p>"Heads up, it's going to feel a bit weird. 3, 2, 1, Link Minds."</p>
                <p>Sparks of electricity hit my temples. From the way Soleil jolted upright, it looked like it worked.</p>
                <p>"...That is not how I expected it to feel like," Soleil thought. "But I think we're settled!"</p>
                <p>I closed my eyes and coated her with a wave of energy. When I opened them, Soleil's appearance changed to the one I pictured.</p>
                <p>"Ha! I told you," Ariadne said to Persephone.</p>
                <p>Persephone said nothing and unlocked Soleil's cell. Soleil walked out, pushing Persephone aside and looking down on the other students.</p>
                <p>"I am not an actress..." she thought. "Oh, Blossom's here. I'll try to break her out."</p>
                <p>"Ugh, they really need to renew this spell..." she said aloud.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>For a split second, light shot of her hands, which I quickly changed to look like darkness.</p>
                <p>"Pretend that nothing happened," she thought. I assumed that's what she was whispering to Blossom.</p>
            </div>
            <div>
                <p>"HELIA! Did you undo the hypnosis?!"</p>
                <p>"Fine! I DID snap them out of it!"</p>
                <p>Helia was taking the blame?</p>
                <p>"Go ahead! Throw me in a cell! See if I care!"</p>
                <p>They grabbed Helia and locked her in the cell Soleil had been in.</p>
                <p>"Look, I'm s—" I started to apologize.</p>
                <p>"Willpower."</p>
                <p>Helia shot me with a burst of blue light. It gave me more strength to keep the illusion up.</p>
                <p>"Thanks..."</p>
                <p>"Honestly, that's impressive. How'd you keep both of those spells for that long?"</p>
                <p>"Concentration. A lot of concentration."</p>
